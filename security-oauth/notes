OAuth2.0
    An authorization framework

OICD (OpenID Connect)
    An OAuth 2.0 extension putting function and form to a user's profile information
    A special case of OAuth 2.0

OAuth Extensions
    JWT
    Token Revocation
    Token Introspection
    Dynamic Client Registration
    Authorization Server Metadata Discovery

JWT (JSON Web Token)
    OAuth doesn't require JWTs but it's common
    JWTs are encoded, not encrypted
    Sensitive information should not be put in a JWT
        Use JWE (encrypted JWT) should be used instead for that
    Include iss (issuer), iat (issued at time), sub (subject), aud (audience), and exp (experience)

Token Revocation
    Revokes (cancels) a token via API
    Technically optional
        In practice, it's required

Token Introspection
    Examines a token to describe its contents
    Useful for opaque tokens
    Describes if the token is active or not
    Mandatory if you have token revocation

Dynamic Client Registration
    Defines a consistent API for creating OAuth clients
    Useful in self-service API developer portals
    Followed by dynamic client management

Authorization Server Metadata
    Allows us to query the auth server and get a json of it's capabilities to configure an application

OpenID Connect
    Rigidly defined
    Strictly structured JWTs
    As an extenstion to OAuth, it is widely used
    Benefits:
        ID Token
            Must be a JWT
            Has naming requirements
            Typically the user's profile information
        Userinfo Endpoint
            Used to retrieve user info
            Same info as available as JWT
        Authorization Code, Implicit
            Only supports subset of authorization grant types

OAuth Concepts
    Scopes are your permissions
    An access token represents your current authorization
    A refresh token represents your next authorization
        This is taken back to authoriation server and a new access token is requested
    Grant types or flows are how you retrieve tokens

OAuth Grant Types
    Authorization Code Flow
        Back-end apps
    Implicit/Authorization Code With PKCE
        Mobile apps or SPAs
    Client Credential
        Service accounts or microservices
    Resource Owner Password (should not be used often)
        Legacy apps

OAuth2.0 Endpoints
    /authorize
        Used for anything user facing
        Gets the authorization grant and user content
    /token
        Used to retrieve the token
        The only endpoint used in resource owner password or client credential

Possible OAuth Endpoints
    /introspect
        Analyze/Decode a token
    /revoke
        Invalidate an access or refresh token
    /userinfo (OIDC)
        Publishes user profile data
    /.well-known/oauth-authorization-serve3r
        OAuth discovery document
        Fixed endpoint (no creation of URL pattern)

OAuth2.0 Scopes
    have to be unique strings

Scope Naming Schemes:
    Simple Strings (read, write, delete, admin:delete)
    Java-Style Namespaces
        Expressive
        Granular
        Predictable
        Incredibly long and complex
        ex: company.resource.action
    URL-Style
        Expressive
        Granular
        Predictable
        API could be self-documenting
        ex: api.company.com/resource.action

Scope Naming Guidelines
    Be consistent

No "Admin" Scopes
    Too vague and broad, likely to cause problems

OAuth2.0 Tokens
    Access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client
        Usually opaque to the client
        Represents specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource and authorization server
    Refresh token is a string representing the authorization granted to the client by the resource owner
        Usually opaque to the client
        Denotes an identifier to retrieve the authorization information

Opaque Tokens
    Nothing to see
    Unique string that acts as a database key
    Only useful at the authorization server

JWT
    Full of authorization and profile data
    Once validated, can use the name/value pairs (claims) to make further decisions for apps in terms of access or retrieving further information

Validating JWT
    Validating establishes trust
    Steps
        Retrieve your signing keys (public key that it was signed with)
        Use periods to separate the token into header, payload, signature
        Take the header, decode from base-64
        Grab the key_id (kid) which should reference a key form the original document
            No match: Document is out of date or token is not valid
        Use the referenced key to sign the payload and compare it against the original signature
            No match: Token is not valid or not for you, should be rejected
        Look at four claims from the payload
            iss: Should match our authorization server
            aud: Should match values set in the authorization server
            cid(client id): Should match our app client id (requestor)
            exp: Should be in the future. If in the past, token cannot be trusted
    If any of these steps are failed, the token is invalid and should not be used for anything
    Token validation is all or nothing
        No partially validated tokens
    Use common libraries to handle this (do not build yourself)

Access Token
    When making a request to an API, use the access token
    API does work and returns data
    If a bad person steals the token, they can use it until expiration
    This is why PII should not be on the token!
    This is why there is also a token revocation spec

Refresh Token
    Opaque (not JWT)
        Nothing to see here
    Can only be used in the token endpoint of our authorization server
        The server can take the refresh token, ensures its active, and issues a new active and refresh token
        Can be revoked but still must be protected
        If a bad person steals this, they can get a new access and refresh token

ID Token
    Always JWT (OIDC)
    Highly structured and defined
    100% predictable

OpenID Connect
    Primary cases are authentication and profile creation
    Because we can validate the token, we can use it to log into our system or generate a user profile (if the token is trusted)

Handling Tokens Safely
    ID Tokens
        User profile data
        Can only be seen by actual user and systems shared with
        Don't keep data if you don't need to
        Delete whenever
    Access Token
        Authorization data
        Read only, low risk data: long expiration
        Read only, sensitive data: shorter expiration
        Read write, sensitive data: very short
    Refresh Tokens
        Retrieve a new access token
        Can only protect by revoking if we know someone malicious has one
    Always protect your tokens

OAuth2.0 Authorization Code Flow
    Client -> Resource -> Authorization Server -> Authentication Requested -> Successful AuthN -> Returns an AuthZ Code
    Web App Sends AuthZ Code + Client Id + Client Secret To Token Endpoint -> Returned Access/Refresh Tokens

Benefits
    Only the one-time use Authorization Code is exposed
    Application never sees the user's credentials
    User never sees the access or refresh tokens

When To Use Authorization Code Flow
    Retrieving the token requires the auth code, client id, and client secret
    You should only use this when you have a user and application (with a back end component) involved
    It cannot be used for microservices due to the lack of a user
    Since we need the the client secret, mobile apps cant be used since the app cannot securely store a secret

PKCE
    For single page apps (SPAs) and mobile apps, we cannot store a client secret so Authorization Code Flow cannot be used
    Instead we use Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)
        Behaves like auth code but doesn't use a client secret
        Code verifier is generated and kept on the local system (random URL safe string of atleast 43 characters)
        Code challenge is created (Base64 encoded SHA256 hash of the code verifier)
        Code challenge is sent with the authorization request
        Authorization server responds back (assuming correct authentication) with an authorization code
        When the authorization code is sent to request tokens, the code verifier is sent in the request
            The authorization server hashes and encodes the verified to compare against the original challenge sent
            Since the original verifier was never sent previously, the authorization server knows it's still dealing with the original client

When To Use PKCE
    Any front-end application that cannot keep secrets
        Mobile Apps
        Single Page Web Apps
        Public Clients
    Limitations
        No Refresh Token
            Cannot store secrets
            Local code challenge

Authorization Code Security Considerations
    Always use SSL/TLS (HTTPS)
    Validate your tokens
    Protect the auth code
        Can only be used once and expires in 60 seconds
    Don't worry about the access token
    Protect your redirect_uri
        Most auth providers force you to white list redirect uri's so our server won't send auth codes to arbitrary uris
        Hacker will still need auth code or code verifier
    Auth code is *hard* to compromise (unless app itself or user is compromised)

OAuth2.0 Implicit Flow
    Not technically deprecated
    Effectively deprecated by Authorization Code with PKCE
    Client -> Authorization Server -> Perform Authentication -> Captures Access Token

Benefits of Implicit
    Application never sees user's credentials
    Mobile or browser app uses the underlying session storage so single sign-on scenarios work as expected

Drawbacks of Implicit
    Access token is exposed to the end-user and therefore at risk
    This doesn't support refresh tokens

Generally, use Authorization Code with PKCE instead

When To Use Implicit Grant Type
    It is not inherently insecure
        Access tokens in URLs is risky at best (mitigated by POSTing to auth server)
    CORS is more stable now (now we can make a POST to our authorization server)
    Should be plan B

Implicit Security Considerations
    Always use SSL/TLS (HTTPS)
    Validate your tokens
    Protect your redirect uri
    Don't use GET (since tokens are passed in the URL)
    Use CORS
        If CORS is supported, typically Auth Code with PKCE will also be supported

OAuth2.0 Resource Owner Password
    99.9% of the time, it's the wrong answer
    Doomed to be insecure
    Client -> Resource -> Presented with Login Form (application creating login page) -> Authorization Server -> Gets Access Token

Resource Owner Password Drawbacks
    Application has user's credentials
    Doesn't support refresh tokens

When To Use Resource Owner Password
    Almost never
        Should be considered the last option
    Why does this even exist?
        Pragmatism
        Designers knew that there could be legacy applications that expect a username/password
        Bridge legacy systems to OAuth
        Fundamentally get old application to speak OAuth
        It's a path, not a destination

Resource Owner Password Security Considerations
    Always use SSL/TLS (HTTPS)
    Validate your tokens
    Fundamental Risk: User Credentials
        OAuth scopes don't help
        Token revocation doesn't help
    Last option, but not a good choice
