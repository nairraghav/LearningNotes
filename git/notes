Reasons to Force Push
    Local version is better than the remote version
    Remote version went wrong and needs repeair
    Versions have diverged and merging is undesirable

How To Force Push
    git push -f 
    git push --force

Force Pushing To A Remote
    Use with extreme caution
    Easy way to anger your whole development team
    Disruptive for others using the remote branch
    Commits disappear
    Subsequent commits are orphaned

Identify Merged Branches
    List branches that have been merged into a branch
    Useful for knowing what features have been incorporated
    Useful for cleanup after merging many features
    Uses the current branch by default
    "Branches whose tips are reachable from the specified commit (HEAD if not specified)"
    Branch tip is in the history of the specified commit
    Can specify other branch names or commits

How To Check For Merged Branches
    git branch --merged (shows local branches merged into current branch)
    git branch --no-merged (shows local branches not merged into current branch)
    git branch -r --merged (shows remote branches merged into current branch)
    git branch --merged HEAD
    git branch --merged july_release (starts at tip july_release, we can also use commit hashes)

Delete Local and Remote Branches
    # must be on different branch from branch to be deleted
        git branch -d branch_name (this deletes the local branch, checks to see if unmerged)
        git branch -D branch_name ()
