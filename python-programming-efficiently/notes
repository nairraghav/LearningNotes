2. WRITING PYTHON EFFICIENTLY
Iterator
    Objects that define __next__()
    Stop iteration with the StopIteration exception

Useful Iterators in Itertools
    Concatenate - itertools.chain(iter1, iter2)
    Duplicate - i1, i2 = itertools.tee(iter, 2)
    Running Sum - itertools.accumulate(iter)
    Element by Element product - itertools.product(iter1, iter2)
    Permutations - itertools.permutations(string)
    Combinations - itertools.combinations(string)

Generators can be created with comprehensions by replacing the brackets with parenthesis
    
Example Generator With Parenthesis
    even = (i for i in range(20) if i % 2 == 0) # creates  generator of even numbers from 0, 20

Example Generator With Yield
    def fibonacci():
    f1, f2 = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield f2
        f1, f2 = f2, f1 + f2

The above function will never end

How to use:
    f = fibonacci()
    [next(f) for i in range(20)] # creates an array of the first 20 fibonacci numbers

Named Tuple
    A map whose fields cannot be modified (think tuple key/value)

Named Tuple Example
    import collections
    medal = collections.namedtuple('medal', ['year', 'athlete', 'team', 'event'])
    m = medal('1896', 'Thomas Burke', 'USA', '100m men')
    m.year, m.athelete #returns '1896', 'Thomas Burke'

Using Counter
    teams = collections.Counter(medal.team for medal in medals) # Returns each medal.team + how many times they show up in the medal collection

Default Dict
    Default dicts can be used when we want to have a collection as values in a dictionary
    Example
        events_by_athlete = collections.defaultdict(set) # here each value for key in dict is a set
        for medal in medals:
            events_by_athlete[medal.athlete].add(medal.event)

Using Sets
    Sets can take advantage of using intersect (&), union(|), and difference (-)

Taking Advantage of kwargs to make a filter
def findmedal(**kwargs): # makes a dict
    return [medal for medal in medals
                  if all(getattr(medal,key) == value for key,value in kwargs.items()]
    # for all kwargs, we take the key/value pair and get all medals that fulfill all medal[key] == value
    # for example, you would run medals = findmedal(year="1900", team="USA") to get all medals from team USA in 1900



4. ADVANCED: PYTHON OBJECT-ORIENTED AND FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
Programming Paradigms
    Procedural: follow a list of instructions (C, Basic, Assembly, SH, Python)
    Object-Oriented: Create and maniplate a collection of objects (Java)
    Functional: Specify data flow and transformations between functions (Haskell)
    Declarative Specify the problem, the language will solve it (SQL)

Object-Oriented Programming Principles
    Abstraction / Encapsulation
        Separate interface and implementation
        Group data members and methods together
    Inheritance
        Build more specialized objects from simpler ones
    Polymorphism / Dynamic Dispatch
        Process objects depending on their type
        Choose version of function depending on object
